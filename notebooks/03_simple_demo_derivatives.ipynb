    "# Adaptive Derivative Fitting Demo\n",

    "- **Target function:**\n",
    "  $f(x) = \\sin(5x) + 0.5x$\n",
    "  This function exhibits both rapid oscillations and a linear trend, making it an ideal test case for evaluating the robustness of derivative estimation methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Evaluation point:**\n",
    "  $x_0 = 0.4$\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Noise model:**\n",
    "  Additive Gaussian noise with standard deviation $\\sigma = 0.02$ is injected to simulate uncertainty in function values.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Fitting method:**\n",
    "  We use the `AdaptiveFitDerivative` approach to fit a local polynomial to noisy samples around $x_0$. The method:\n",
    "  - selectively prunes high-residual points to improve robustness,\n",
    "  - fits a polynomial to the remaining data, and\n",
    "  - visualizes the result by plotting:\n",
    "    - points used vs. excluded in the fit,\n",
    "    - the fitted polynomial curve, and\n",
    "    - a shaded tolerance band indicating the residual threshold.\n"
