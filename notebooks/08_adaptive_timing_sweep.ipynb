    "### 1. `benchmark_derivative_timing_vs_order`\n",
    "\n",
    "This function evaluates the total execution time required to compute derivatives of a given function using both **adaptive** and **finite difference** methods across a range of derivative orders.\n",

    "Each method is timed individually for a given order:\n",
    "\n",
    "Plot Interpretation:\n",
    "- The x-axis shows the derivative order (e.g. 1st, 2nd, 3rd).\n",
    "- The y-axis shows the total evaluation time in seconds.\n",
    "- You can compare how much slower the adaptive method is for higher-order derivatives.\n",

    "\n",
    "### 2. `plot_adaptive_timing_sweeps`\n",
    "\n",
    "This function benchmarks the adaptive method only, and investigates how its runtime changes as you sweep two of its internal parameters:\n",

    "- `fit_tolerance`: The RMS error threshold used to accept a candidate polynomial\n",
    "\n",
    "The function runs two separate benchmark loops:\n",
    "- First, it varies `min_used_points` while keeping `fit_tolerance` fixed.\n",

    "\n",
    "Plot Interpretation:\n",
    "- Left panel: Timing vs min_used_points (larger values = more data used for fitting)\n",
    "- Right panel: Timing vs fit_tolerance (smaller values = stricter fits, more iterations)\n",
    "- Results are shown for each derivative order with different line colors\n",
    "- The log-scaled $x$-axis in the right plot emphasizes sensitivity to small tolerances\n",

    "**Notes**\n",
    "Both methods use `time.perf_counter()` to measure high-resolution wall-clock time.\n",
    "Artificial delays (`sleep_time`) are used to simulate slow function evaluations and highlight overhead\n",
    "These plots help understand the trade-off between speed and flexibility in adaptive differentiation.\n"
